    "subject": "Security Update: New Archive System Code",
    "body": "Dear Team,\n\nTo bolster our archive system security, we've implemented a new four-character hexadecimal access code. To derive it, take the number of letters in 'archive' and convert it to its hexadecimal equivalent. Then, append the hexadecimal value of the number of working days in a week (excluding weekends). This code is mandatory for accessing the archive system effective immediately.\n\nRegards,\nEmily Watson\nArchive Manager",
    "answer": "7C05",
    "explanation": "To find the access code, solve the puzzle: The word 'archive' has 7 letters, which is 7 in decimal and 7C in hexadecimal (since 7 is represented as 7C in a two-character hex format for consistency). A standard workweek has 5 working days (Monday to Friday), which is 05 in hexadecimal. Concatenating these gives the four-character hex string 7C05."
