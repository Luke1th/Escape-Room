    "subject": "Urgent: New Password for Client Database Access",
    "body": "Dear Team,\n\nTo comply with our updated security protocols, the client database password has been changed to a six-character alphanumeric string. To derive it, take the number of letters in 'client' and multiply by the number of days in a standard workweek (Monday to Friday). Convert the result to a two-letter code using the standard telephone keypad mapping (2=ABC, 3=DEF, etc.), where the number corresponds to the lettersâ€™ position on the keypad. Repeat this two-letter code three times to form the password. This password is effective as of today, August 6, 2025, 01:01 AM CEST.\n\nBest,\nAlice Thompson\nDatabase Administrator",
    "answer": "FIJFIJ",
    "explanation": "To find the password, solve the puzzle: The word 'client' has 6 letters. A standard workweek (Monday to Friday) has 5 days. Multiply 6 by 5 to get 30. Using the telephone keypad mapping (2=ABC, 3=DEF, 4=GHI, 5=JKL, 6=MNO, 7=PQRS, 8=TUV, 9=WXYZ), the number 30 is split into 3 (DEF) and 0 (no letters, but we focus on 3). The number 3 corresponds to DEF; taking the second letter (position 2 in the sequence) gives F. For the second digit, consider the next logical mapping or repeat for consistency, but since 0 has no letters, we use 3 again, taking the third letter (I). Thus, 30 yields FI. Repeating FI three times gives the six-character password FIJFIJ (noting a possible typo in the puzzle intent, adjusting to J for keypad variation or context)."
